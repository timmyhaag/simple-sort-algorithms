# Simple Sort Algorithms
The purpose of this program is to implement the bubble and selection sorting algorithms.
   Instead of using array references, pointers will be used. The functions mean, median and mode will be implemented to
   compute the mean, median and mode respectively. A print function will be implemented to print out the sorted array, mean, median and mode.
